TermSuite is the Open Source and UIMA-based application drawn out from the European project [TTC](http://www.ttc-project.eu/index.php) _Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora_. This project aims at leveraging machine translation, computer-assisted translation and multilingual content management tools by automatically generating bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora in five European languages (English, French, German, Spanish and one under-resourced language, Latvian), as well as in Chinese and Russian.

TermSuite extracts monolingual terminologies and generates bilingual dictionaries from these terminologies by the means of distributional and compositional methods from texts.
